# HeartFailurePrediction_NB

**Description:**

The code above applies the Naive Bayes algorithm to a dataset of heart failure patients. The code first performs data exploration and visualization, including calculating correlations and plotting histograms for each feature. Then, it splits the data into training and test sets and trains a Naive Bayes model on the training set.

The model's accuracy on the test set is then evaluated, and a confusion matrix is generated to visualize the model's performance. Finally, the code performs a grid search to find the optimal parameters for the Naive Bayes model and re-evaluates the model's performance with the optimal parameters.
